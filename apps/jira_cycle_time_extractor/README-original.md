Production-ready. This tool is designed to extract data from JIRA and convert it into Excel or CSV format. Automatically, it includes all essential stage (ie. in dev, in code review, in testing) duration data and enhances it with flow status and stage start dates with no further setting required. Consequently, it enables easy calculation and visualization of cycle time, lead time, and velocity.

Consequently, data is ready for further analytics and visualization in Google Sheet charts, Excel, Tableau, Looker, or Power BI. 

# Analytics
With obtained data, we can explore/analyze team efficiency metrics
 - DORA metrics: lead time or cycle time, deployment frequency, mean time to recover, change failure rate
 - Investment allocation and roadmap contribution by labels or epic links
 - Number of backtracks
 - Sprint completion
 - Throughput and Velocity

# Install
There are two options for running this extract utility: either as a standalone exectuable or as a nodejs app.

## Option 1: Using the Standalone Executable
1. Download and install the Node.js app from https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Download the latest "SourceCode.zip" from [releases](https://github.com/marian-kamenistak/jira-lead-cycle-time-duration-extractor/releases/) and unpack the whole zip. You should have a "run.js" and "config.yaml" files in the same directory.
3. Edit the config.yaml file and customize it for your specific Jira instance according to the instructions in this README below. 
4. Open a command prompt, move to the directory where both "run.js" and "config.yaml" files are located and run it by simply typing ```node run.js```
5. If you receive an ``` Error: Invalid URI``` error, make sure you define the right Jira config parameters in the config.yaml file.
5. If the program succeeds, the output data file will be written in the same directory as the executable file.

## Option 2: Clone the source code

1. Install git from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
2. Clone the project using git to your local device using command ```git clone https://github.com/marian-kamenistak/jira-lead-cycle-time-duration-extractor.git```
3. install npm tool from https://nodejs.org/en/download
4. in the project folder, install all the dependent packages using command

       npm install    
    
       npm run build
    
   configure the config.yaml file for your connection
    
       npm run extract

### Run 'npm run extract' with configuration parameters
These flags are the same whether you are using the standalone executable or node form of the extraction tool.

-i specifies input config file name (defaults to config.yaml)

-u specifies the username for the connection to Jira (by default the username in the config.yaml is used)

-p specifies the password for the connection to Jira (by default the password in the config.yaml is used)

### Node js troubleshooting
    npm cache clean -f
    npm install -g n
    n stable

# Configuration

Edit config.yaml file

The config file we use conforms to the YAML format standard (http://yaml.org/spec/) and is completely case sensitive. You can find an example config file here: [config.yaml](https://github.com/marian-kamenistak/jira-data-extractor/blob/main/config.yaml). Feel free to follow along with that example as we run through the details of each section of the file.


## Connection

    Connection:
        Domain: https://<your jira domain>/ Open Jira in your browser and see the domain name in the browser link.
        Username: <email> Use an email you use to access Jira.
        Password: <Jira API token> is your Jira API Token. The token can be generated at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens


### Jira connection test
in your console, run:

    curl -v https://<yourdomain>.atlassian.net/ --user <email>:<Jira API token>


## Jira issues selection
is driven by a JQL statement. Examples:

    JQL: 
        Query: created >= -30d order by created DESC
        Query: key=EPM-197
        Query: project in ("Team A", "Team B")
    
To create the right JQL query, open Jira -> Filter -> 'Advanced issue search' and build the query.


## Jira fields
The Attributes Section of the config file is simply named "Attributes" (without the quotes) and is another optional section that includes name-value pairs that you want included in your extracted data set. They may be Jira custom fields that are unique to your Jira instance, or certain standard Jira fields that we support. Each line in this section contains the name you want to appear as the attribute column name in the CSV file, followed by a colon, followed by the name of a Jira custom field or a supported standard field, like this:

Here are the standard Jira fields that you can use:

    Attributes:
          Stage: status.name      
          StatusCategory: status.statusCategory.name    
          Level: priority.name
          Labels: labels
          Components: components.name
          Version: fixVersions.last.name
          VersionRelease: fixVersions.last.releaseDate
          ParentId: parent.key
          ParentName: parent.fields.summary
          ParentType: parent.fields.issuetype.name
          Timeoriginalestimate: timeoriginalestimate
          Sprint: customfield_10105.last.name        
          Priority: priority.name
          Project: project.name          
          #Service: customfield_18801.value
          #Account: customfield_20397.value
          Timeoriginalestimate: timeoriginalestimate    
          Timeestimate: timeestimate
          Timespent: timespent
          AggreagateTimeoriginalestimate: aggregatetimeoriginalestimate
          AggreagateTimeestimate: aggregatetimeestimate
          AggreagateTimespent: aggregatetimespent
          Workratio: workratio

            

In order to add more of your custom parameters, see what other data fields an issue contains. You can use 

    curl --request GET \
      --url 'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}' \
      --user 'email@example.com:<api_token>' \
      --header 'Accept: application/json'
